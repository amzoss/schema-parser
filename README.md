# FOLIO Schema Parser

This repository contains a back-up of a Google Apps Script used to populate data in a Google Spreadsheet. The purpose is to automate the creation of a lightweight [data dictionary](https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36573674) for FOLIO data, including supplemental information about how FOLIO data appear in the [Library Data Platform](https://librarydataplatform.org/).

This script is meant to be attached to a Google Sheet as an Apps Script. The Sheet must also be designed so that the first tab includes descriptive information and links to the FOLIO data documentation that can be parsed by the script.
